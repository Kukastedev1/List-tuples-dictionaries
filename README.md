Python Data Structure operations
This project contains three Python scripts demonstrating the core behaviors of Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries.

Demonstrates mutable sequence handling.

Initializes a collection of items.

Performs end-of-list insertion.

Removes elements by index.

2. Tuple Exploration (tuples.py)
Demonstrates immutable data storage and concatenation.

Defines fixed data records.

Validates that elements cannot be modified or deleted.

Shows how to merge two tuples into a new object.

3. Dictionary Mapping (dictionaries.py)
Demonstrates key-value pair management.

Maps unique keys to specific data values.

Updates existing values and adds new entries.

Handles secure data retrieval and deletion.
